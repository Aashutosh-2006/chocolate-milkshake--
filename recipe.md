Tips
Don’t forget a creamy topping, colorful sprinkles, or maraschino cherries. Look for refrigerated whipped topping in a can, made with real cream, and hunt down compostable paper straws or long sundae spoons for fun.
Set up a milkshake bar for the family using the recipe (have double the ingredients ready) as a starting point. Put out small dishes of candy-coated chocolate pieces, thick caramel or butterscotch ice cream topping, toffee baking bits, and/or broken cream-filled wafer cookies or gingersnaps to top the milkshakes. Be sure to use a heavy-duty blender!
Adding 1 tablespoon malted milk powder will add that ‘50s diner vibe to the thick shakes
